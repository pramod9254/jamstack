Cheaper.","content":"\n<p>Moving your WordPress frontend to the Jamstack means you keep the convenience of using WordPress’s custom backend for creating and editing content <em>while also</em> avoiding some of WordPress’s biggest downsides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, WordPress has many downsides, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Security</strong> — because it’s the most popular content management system in the world, hackers work hard to find and exploit security holes in WordPress sites.</li><li><strong>Performance</strong> — through a combination of legacy code, community plugins, and other challenges, WordPress sites can easily become slow to load.</li><li><strong>Scale</strong> — if a WordPress site suddenly becomes very popular (a great thing!) it can overload servers and cause the website to go down (a not-so-great thing!) without complex scaling techniques.</li><li><strong>Cost</strong> — a WordPress site requires always-on hosting, and specialized hosting can be expensive. Adding support to handle massive scale adds significant cost, too.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Switching to the Jamstack helps mitigate — and even eliminate! — these downsides:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>More secure</strong> — Jamstack sites don’t connect to the server or database after they’re built. This makes it much harder to hack the site.</li><li><strong>More performant</strong> — by doing less work for each request and leveraging modern tools, Jamstack sites tend to outperform WordPress sites out of the box, and can be <em>very</em> fast with a bit of extra effort.</li><li><strong>More resilient</strong> — because Jamstack sites ship to a content delivery network (CDN) by default, a sudden surge of site visitors won’t take your site down.</li><li><strong>More affordable</strong> — many Jamstack hosting solutions have generous free tiers that are plenty for most small to medium sites, and upgraded accounts typically cost less than specialized WordPress hosting.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Switching to the Jamstack gives you all of the benefits of WordPress <em>and</em> helps you avoid the downsides!</p>\n"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDox"}}}
